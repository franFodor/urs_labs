A little project made for the development board at FER with ATmega4809 microcontroller. Contains functions for initializing various peripherals in utils.c file.

Made for easier solving of labaratory exercises so that I don't have to write functions multiple times. Basically a compilation of everything learned with 8-bit microcontrollers on the course.
