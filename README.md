Labaratory exercises for development board at FER with ATmega4809 microcontroller and STM32F407. Contains functions for initializing various peripherals in `utils.c` file.

Made for easier solving of labaratory exercises so that I don't have to write functions multiple times. Basically a compilation of everything learned with 8-bit microcontrollers on the course and 32-bit in the 32bit folder.
